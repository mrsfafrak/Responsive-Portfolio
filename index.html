                                <p>Hello! My name is Victoria Fafrak, but I prefer to go by Tori.
                                    Victoria is so formal; however, don't ever call me Vicky! I grew up in Solon, Ohio
                                    but now reside in Hudson, Ohio with my husband, my dog and a baby on the way. I love
                                    playing volleyball and watching HGTV. </p>
                                <p>I am a Univeristy of Dayton graduate (GO FLYERS!) with a degree in Chemical
                                    Engineering and Environmental Engineering. Upon the conclusion of my fifth year at UD (also
                                    known as a victory lap year), I entered the consulting field of wastewater engineering.
                                    Yes, I designed how to treat your poop water. You're welcome :-) Let the poop jokes ensue!</p>
                                <p>After 2 years of pursuing that career, I switched to the regulatory side of the
                                    industry and obtained a position at the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency in the Division
                                    of Surface Water where I worked for 4 years. I regulated wastewater treatment plants
                                    in Northeast Ohio much to their dismay.
                                    During this time, I also became licensed as a Professional Engineer (PE).</p>
                                <p>After those 4 years, I still didn't feel I was reaching my full potential and was
                                    looking to switch it up. I started dabbling on my own in learning some code, but I
                                    knew I needed to take it to the next level if I wanted this path to go anywhere. I stumbled upon Case
                                    Western Reserve University's Coding Bootcamp, and I got in! So in January 2019, I began my journey
                                    to take learning all I could in the wide world of code!</p>
