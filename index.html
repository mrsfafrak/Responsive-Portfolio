                <p>Hello! My name is Victoria Fafrak, but I prefer to go by Tori. Victoria is so formal; however, don't
                    ever
                    call me Vicky! I grew up in Solon, Ohio but now reside in Hudson, Ohio with my husband, my dog and
                    a
                    baby
                    on the way. I love playing volleyball and watching HGTV. </p>
            </div>
            <p>I am a Univeristy of Dayton graduate (GO FLYERS!) with a degree in Chemical Engineering and
                Environmental
                Engineering. Upon the conclusion of my fifth year at UD (also known as a victory lap year), I
                entered
                the
                consulting field of wastewater engineering. Yes, I designed how to treat your poop water. You're
                welcome
                :-) Let the poop jokes ensue!</p>

            <p>After 2 years of pursuing that career, I switched to the regulatory side of the industry and
                obtained a
                position at the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency in the Division of Surface Water where I
                worked
                for 4
                years. I regulated wastewater treatment plants in Northeast Ohio much to their dismay. During this
                time, I
                also became licensed as a Professional Engineer (PE).</p>

            <p>After those 4 years, I still didn't feel I was reaching my full potential and was looking to switch
                it
                up. I
                started dabbling on my own in learning some code, but I knew I needed to take it to the next level
                if I
                wanted this path to go anywhere. I stumbled upon Case Western Reserve University's Coding Bootcamp,
                and
                I
                got in! So in January 2019, I began my journey to take learning all I could in the wide world of
                code!</p>
